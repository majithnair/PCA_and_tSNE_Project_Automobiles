## Project: PCA and tSNE

-----------------------------

Welcome to the project on PCA and tSNE. In this project. We will be using the auto-mpg dataset.

-----------------------------
## Objective: 
-----------------------------
The objective of this problem is to explore the data and reduce the number of features by using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and TSNE and generate meaningful insights. 

-----------------------------
## Dataset: 
-----------------------------
There are 8 variables in the data: 

- mpg: miles per gallon
- cyl: number of cylinders
- disp: engine displacement (cu. inches) or engine size
- hp: horsepower
- wt: vehicle weight (lbs.)
- acc: time taken to accelerate from O to 60 mph (sec.)
- yr: model year
- car name: car model name
